# Weather-App

In this project I created a .net weather app with c#, which uses an API from weatherstack to get weather information all over the world.
By default it displays the local weather in Johannesburg(South Africa).
You can also use search to find the current weather at a city, for example London or Paris.
The app displays local temperature, gives you a brief description and also shows an icon based on the weather.
